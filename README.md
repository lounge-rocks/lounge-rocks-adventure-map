# WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit

This is a starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

## Tools you will need

In order to build your own map for WorkAdventure, you need:

- the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software
- "tiles" (i.e. images) to create your map (this starter kit provides a good default tileset for offices)
- a web-server to serve your map (this starter kit proposes to use Github static pages as a web-server which is both free and performant)

### Loading the map in Tiled

The sample map is in the file `map.json`.
You can load this file in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

Now, it's up to you to edit the map and write your own map.

Some resources regarding Tiled:

- [Tiled documentation](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/introduction/)
- [Tiled video tutorials](https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/10/14/Tiled-Map-Editor-Tutorial-Series.aspx)

### About WorkAdventu.re maps

In order to design a map that will be readable by WorkAdventure, you will have to respect some constraints.

In particular, you will need to:

- set a start position for the players
- configure the "floor layer" (so that WorkAdventure can correctly display characters above the floor, but under the ceiling)
- eventually, you can place exits that link to other maps

All this is described in the [WorkAdventure documentation](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure/#designing-a-map).
Please be sure to check it out.
